# Introduction 
Snake and ladder or Ludo,are the most favourite games of all time. But, sometimes we are not able to paly these cool games just because we can't find the Dice. So, this program is best alternative for the dice and can be made using Python.

# dice-rolling-simulator
Dice Rolling Simulator - A small python project using Tkinter. Tkinter is the most common, fast, and easy to use Python package used to build Graphical User Interface applications. 

# What is Dice simulator?
Dice is a small cube with 1-6 numbers on its all faces and from simulation i mean imitation of a situation or process. Dice rolling simulator a simple model which rolls the dice for us on computer and shows a random number everytime. 

# Modules imported
We import the following modules for the program : 
1. Tkinter
2. Image 
3. Random

# Main body
we will build the main window of our application using Tkinter like buttons, texts and images of Dice. 

after building the main window we will add all the possible outcomes of the dice images (i.e. 6) to a variable like "Dice". 

To make images randomly displayed, simulate the dice with random numbers between 1 to 6 and generate the images.

Now build a label widget for image and a button, Assign the functionality to the button to make the dice roll.

And at last to keep the window open after rolling use .mainloop()

# Output
We will see a window with the our headings, a dice and a button to roll the dice.
when user click the button, the button function will trigger and generate a random image of dice with a number between 1 to 6 and using .mainloop(), it will agian get ready for second move.
